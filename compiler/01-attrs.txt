* constructor/destructor
  constructor(priority)/destructor(priority)

  The constructor attribute causes the function to be called automatically
  before execution enters main(). Similarly, the destructor attribute causes
  the function to be called automatically after main() has completed or exit
  has been called. (But _exit() function would directly terminate process, so
  the destructor functions would not be called.)

  You may provide an optional integer priority to control the order in which
  constructor and destructor functions are run. A constructor with a smaller
  priority number runs before a constructor with a larger priority number. the
  opposite relationship holds for destructors. (The priority [0,100] are
  reserved for compiler internals.)

* deprecated/deprecated(msg)
  The attribute results in a warning if the function is used anywhere in the
  source file.

* format (archetype, string-index, first-to-check)
  The attribute specifies that a function takes printf, scanf, strftime, or
  strfmon style arguments which should be type-checked against a format string.

* format_arg(string-indxe)

* noinline
  Prevents a function from being considered for inlining.

* nonnull(arg-indx, ...)

* noreturn

* pure
  used to elimination loop call.

* hot/cold

* regparm(number)

* returns_twice

* section(section-name)

* unused
  The function may be unused, so gcc will not produce a warning for
  the function.

* used

* warn_unused_result

* weak

* weakref
